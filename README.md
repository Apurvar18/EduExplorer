# EduExplorer
Created a Java Swing-based GUI app to aggregate course data from platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Kaggle, and W3Schools using web scraping and API integration. Users can filter courses by criteria like title, duration, and price, with real-time updates and an intuitive, user-friendly interface for easy access to learning resources.
